# Natas1
This level is similar to natas level 0, in this the makes have disabled the right click fucntionality.
## Intended Solution
1. The intended solution is to use shortcut *Ctrl+U* or use developer's tools with shortcut *Ctrl+Shift+i* to view the source.
1. You could also use the python script similar to one used in first challange.

## Unintended Solution 
But Due to poor implementation the disable right click feature only works if you right click inside the white box. One can *Right-Click* anywhere outside the white box to view the page source.
